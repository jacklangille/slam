# Visual Intertial - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VI-SLAM) from Scratch!
### SLAM
- SLAM is a technique used to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of the camera's position within it.

### VI-SLAM
- Extends regular SLAM by combining visual data from cameras (V) with inertial data from IMUs (I).
