# Visual Intertial - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VI-SLAM) from Scratch! (HEAVY WIP)
### SLAM
- SLAM is a technique used to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of the camera's position within it.

### VI-SLAM
- Extends regular SLAM by combining visual data from cameras (V) with inertial data from IMUs (I). 

### TO DO:
- Temporal tracking
- Incorporate IMU data using Kalman Filter
- Create map
    - Sparse map
    - Dense map
    - Bundle adjustment 
- Loop closure detection
- Trajectory visualization 
- Map visualization
- Optimizee 
- Organize and comment code
